        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing my PhD in Economics at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, 
            specializing in Political Economy, Microeconomic Theory, and Game Theory. My current research explores the political 
            economy of identity, with a focus on how identity and group-specific issues impact political competition and campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
            I completed my M.Sc. in Economics from IIT Roorkee and my B.Sc. in Mathematics from Savitribai Phule Pune University. 
            I have a strong background in mathematics and economics, and I have worked as a summer intern at the Reserve Bank of India, 
            where I contributed to policy research. My long-term goal is to contribute to academia through both teaching and research.
